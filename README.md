Just a little WIP program that allow users to choose implemented cellular automatons with desired speed end size (within some limits).
It uses mostly JAVA FX API at the moment.
TODO list :
 - Specific parameters for each automatons with their own GUI
 - Resizable canvas
 - More cell's state, not just dead or alive
 - Draw a real grid with a better look and customizations (colors for each cell's state)
 - Optimizations (mostly automatons and canvas)
 - Documentation
 - Clean, readable and healthy code
 - Internationalization
